# AutoGram
A script to automate posting on Instagram using selenium, chrome and python

### This only works with Chrome as of now! If you want me to add scripts for FireFox, Safari or Opera shoot me an email: coddiw0mpl4@gmail.com
If you are experienced with Machine Learning, shoot me an email too because I have an interesting idea to implement this script with that.

Make sure to install all the requirements. Download chromedriver for your platform from here: (Chrome 84)[https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=84.0.4147.30/]

## Stuff you have to set up for yourself before you can start posting:
 1) Set your path to your chromedriver that you downloaded. 
 2) Change your username in line 19 and password in line 21.
 3) Path to your image in line 51. Videos haven't been tested yet, but I'd like to get feedback on it, if it doesn't work I'll try something.
 
 Optional : If your chrome browser executable isn't found by Python automagically, add it in line 11
 
 
Please excuse my bad taste in variable names, I'm bad at names.
